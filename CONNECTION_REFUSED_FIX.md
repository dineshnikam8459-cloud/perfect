# ✅ Connection Refused Error - FIXED

## The Problem
The error `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` occurred because:
- Backend was listening on **IPv6 only** (`::`  wildcard)
- Frontend was trying to connect on **IPv4** (`127.0.0.1`)
- They couldn't communicate on different protocols

## Solution Applied

### 1. Backend Fix
**File:** `/workspaces/bhatkar-fragrance-hub/backend/src/index.js`

Changed from:
```javascript
app.listen(PORT, () => {
    logger.info(`Running on PORT ${PORT}`);
});
```

To:
```javascript
app.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0', () => {
    logger.info(`Running on PORT ${PORT}`);
});
```

This makes the backend listen on **all network interfaces** (IPv4 + IPv6).

### 2. Frontend Configuration
**File:** `.env.local`

Updated to:
```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Using `localhost` which resolves to both IPv4 and IPv6.

## Current Status

✅ **Backend running** on `0.0.0.0:3000` (all interfaces)
✅ **Database connected** to `bhatkar_db`
✅ **API endpoints working**:
  - `POST /api/auth/signin` ✅
  - `POST /api/auth/signup` ✅

✅ **Frontend ready** to connect

## What You Need To Do

### Restart Frontend
Kill the current frontend and restart it to pick up the new environment:

```bash
# In the frontend terminal
Ctrl+C  # Stop current process
npm run dev  # Restart
```

## Test Credentials

After restarting frontend, use these to test:

**Email:** `demo@example.com`
**Password:** `demo123456`

## What Changed
- ✅ Backend now accepts connections on all interfaces
- ✅ No more port conflicts or IPv4/IPv6 mismatch
- ✅ Frontend now properly configured
- ✅ Everything should work seamlessly

The connection should now work! 🎉
