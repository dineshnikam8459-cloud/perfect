# Fix Applied: Failed to Fetch Error

## The Problem
The frontend was unable to connect to the backend API because:
1. The `.env.local` was pointing to `localhost:3000` which could resolve to IPv6 in the dev container
2. Frontend needed to pick up the new environment variable

## The Solution Applied

### 1. Updated `.env.local`
Changed from:
```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

To:
```
VITE_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

Using explicit IPv4 address `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost` to avoid IPv6 resolution issues.

### 2. Added Console Logging to AuthContext
Added detailed console logs to help debug any remaining issues:
- `console.log("Attempting login to:", API_URL)`
- `console.log("Response status:", response.status)`
- `console.log("Response data:", result)`
- `console.error("Login/Signup error:", error)`

## What You Need To Do

### ✅ Step 1: Stop and Restart Frontend
The frontend needs to restart to pick up the new environment variables:

```bash
# Kill the current frontend process (Ctrl+C if running)
npm run dev
```

### ✅ Step 2: Test With These Credentials
Backend APIs are confirmed working! Use these test credentials:

**Sign Up:**
- Full Name: Demo User
- Email: demo@example.com  
- Password: demo123456

**Login:**
- Email: demo@example.com
- Password: demo123456

## Verification Steps

1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Try signing up with new credentials
4. You should see:
   - ✅ `Attempting signup to: http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/auth/signup`
   - ✅ `Response status: 201` (for signup) or `200` (for login)
   - ✅ User data logged in console

## If Still Getting "Failed to Fetch"

Check:
1. **Backend is running**: `curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/` should return 200
2. **Frontend restarted**: Kill with Ctrl+C, run `npm run dev` again
3. **Check browser console**: F12 → Console tab, look for detailed error logs
4. **Clear cache**: Ctrl+Shift+Delete (or Cmd+Shift+Delete on Mac)

## Backend Status
✅ **Backend is running on port 3000**
✅ **Signup endpoint working** 
✅ **Login endpoint working**
✅ **CORS enabled**
✅ **Database connected** (bhatkar_db)
